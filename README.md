### About 
**Teeditor** is an unofficial standalone map editor for a retro 2D multiplayer shooter [Teeworlds](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/).

`It is a separate product, associated with the original sources of the game only indirectly. E.g. images of default tilesets, the structure of the .map file.`

### Features
Unlike the standard in-game editor, this application provides a number of new features and conveniences.

For example, such as:
- Program association with .map files (quick map opening without the need to load the game client);
- Simultaneous editing of several files (tabs support);
- Drag&Drop in the Group and Layer Explorer (reordering and changing the nesting level);
- Undo/Redo for a number of important functions with the history of changes (editing layers, editing parameters, etc.);
- Full-featured map navigator in the form of a thumbnail with a view box;
- New animation editor with timer and slider, based on Keyframe-Drag&Drop and giving more control over animation;
- Working in both windowed and full-screen modes;
- A more responsive interface that resembles the original in structure;
- Saving map images;
- Support for dark and light themes;
- Many other smaller improvements.

### Offtop
> The development of the project was started by a simple desire to go back 10 years, when I was having fun playing this seemingly unkillable game. 
> My introduction to the world of programming and the C++ language began with this game. I went to school at the time, I was about 13-14 years old. 
> The power of my computer didn't allow me to play big games, so I stumbled upon TeeWorlds. The only thing I don't remember exactly is how I downloaded Visual Studio that way. 
> I guess I was just wondering what "Source" meant in the link on the download page and what to do with those files. 
> The first thing I programmed at the time was a modified version of the client - a bot for Instagib that fired a laser beam the moment it crossed the 
> line from Tee to the aiming cursor. I didn't distribute it, but I played on the sICTF mod servers for a long time and never got noticed or banned.
