Teeditor is an open-source program for editing [TeeWorlds](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/) (a retro 2D multiplayer shooter) maps and ~~maybe something else~~.\
It is a separate product, associated with the original sources of the game only indirectly (images of default tilesets, the structure of the .map file).\
In a sense, it is a port of the original TeeWorlds map editor from C++ and OpenGL (SDL2.0) to C#, C++ /CX and DirectX 11 (UWP, [Win2D](https://github.com/microsoft/Win2D), [DirectXTK](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK)).\
\
The program is only compatible with the Windows 10 operating system with a minimum version 1809. It is distributed through the Microsoft Windows Store.
