### About
**Teeditor** is an open-source program for editing [TeeWorlds](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/) (a retro 2D multiplayer shooter) maps.\
In a sense, it is a port of the original TeeWorlds map editor from C++ and OpenGL (SDL2.0)
to C#, C++ /CX and DirectX 11 (UWP, [Win2D](https://github.com/microsoft/Win2D), [DirectXTK](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK)).\
`It is a separate product, associated with the original sources of the game only indirectly (images of default tilesets, the structure of the .map file).`

### Distribution
It is distributed through the [Microsoft Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N4ZR48Q22HR).

### Compatibility
The program is only compatible with the Windows 10 operating system with a minimum version 17763.0.

The source code is distributed under the [GPL-3.0 License](https://github.com/michailowski/Teeditor/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
